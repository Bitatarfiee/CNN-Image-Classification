# CNN-Image-Classification
## Description
Make an image classifier using a convolutional neural network.

1. Define Gaussian filter, a Sobel X filter, and a Sobel Y filter
2. 

## Data 
Images used in this code are from CIFAR 10.
CIFAR 10: The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. The classes represent airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. There are 6,000 images in each class.
